A multipurpose Discord bot, development of which is one of my hobbies.
It's called Spy because initially I only wanted this bot to retrieve information about Roblox players. As you can see, this project did gain a lot of traction and now it's capable of doing different things.

This project helps me learn JavaScript (especially Discord.js module, and many others), TypeScript and Git.
Shoutout to [Async](https://github.com/AstroHWeston) for the help and code samples.a
